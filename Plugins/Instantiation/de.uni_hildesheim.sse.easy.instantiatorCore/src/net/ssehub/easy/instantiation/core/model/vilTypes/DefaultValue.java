/**
 * Indicates a data structure containing the default value(s) of a type or of parameters. Two forms
 * are supported:
 * <ol>
 *  <li>In case of a type, a single value (not necessarily of that but a VIL assignable type) 
 *    representing a neutral element, can be marked. This defines the default value of 
 *    the respective type (or if not overriden by a subsequent definition) for the 
 *    derived subtypes.</li>
 *  <li>In case of parameters, a whole static data structure (Map&lt;String, Object&gt; or an Object array with even 
 *    dimension and alternating key-values are supported) can be used to define the relations between parameter names 
 *    and default values. In the latter case, multiple default value attributes can be stated
 *    for different operations, e.g., if the operations overlap in parameter types but not in
 *    default values). The different operations can be indicated by their name using {@link #name()}. 
 *    </li>
 * </ol>
 * Inherited attributes are considered in both cases, i.e., super classes define the default values for subclasses if 
 * not overridden explicitly. If the respective value shall not be visible and the defined static value is not used
 * within the defining class, the annotation {@link SuppressWarnings} may be required for that field in addition.
