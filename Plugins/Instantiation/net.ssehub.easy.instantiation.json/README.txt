This plugin contains the experimental yaml editor which is used 
to edit storm configuration files (i.e. add new parameter). 

Please note that this plugin is highly experimental. Use it with care.

Further instructions on how to use this plugin can be found on the 
storm cluster (see SPASSmeter_README and enableSPASSmeter.sh).
