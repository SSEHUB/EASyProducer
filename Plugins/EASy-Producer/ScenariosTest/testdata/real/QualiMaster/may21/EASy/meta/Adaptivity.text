Adaptivity::updateFrequency = Adaptation frequency (ms)|Longest distance between two adaptation runs in milliseconds.
Adaptivity::updateFrequencyLimit = Update Frequency must be 0 or more than 500
Adaptivity::capacityLowWatermark = Pipeline node low load (%)|The lower load (percentage) boundary causing resource re-allocation for scale-in
Adaptivity::capacityHighWatermark = Pipeline node high load (%)|The upper load (percentage) boundary causing resource re-allocation for scale-out
Adaptivity::capacityHighLowWatermark = Pipeline node low load watermark must be smaller than high watermark
Adaptivity::capacityPipelineSheddingWatermark = Pipeline shedding load (%)|The boundary causing load shedding for extreme overload cases.
Adaptivity::capacityPipelineSheddingWatermarkMin = Pipeline shedding load must be larger than 0.5 (recommended 0.8 or higher)
Adaptivity::capacityAveragePipelineOverload = Pipeline overload (%)|Average boundary enabling overload adaptation
Adaptivity::capacityAveragePipelineOverloadMin = Pipeline overload load must be larger than 0.5 (recommended 0.8 or higher)
Adaptivity::pipelineImportance = Pipeline observable weights|Weights to prioritize the importance of individual observables in single-pipeline adaptation.
Adaptivity::crossPipelineTradeoffs = Cross-pipeline observable weights|Weights to prioritize the importance of individual observables in cross-pipeline adaptation.
Adaptivity::supportsTaskReallocation = support task reallocation|Does the installed platform support task reallocation - set by monitoring.
Adaptivity::maxClusterAllocation = maximum cluster allocation|The maximum rate the cluster shall be allocated, the rest shall be residual.
Adaptivity::QualityParameterWeighting = Defines the weighting for a quality parameter.
Adaptivity::QualityParameterWeighting::parameter = quality parameter|The quality parameter to define a weight for.
Adaptivity::QualityParameterWeighting::weight = weight|The weight to indicate tradeoffs between quality parameters. Negative values cause an inversion by the actual maximum and a weighting by the absolute value.
