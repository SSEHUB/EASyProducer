\section{Frequently Asked Questions}
\label{sec:FAQ}
This section shows frequently recurring problems, their cause, and a solution to solve them. First, in Section \ref{sec:Compilation Errors} we present solutions for errors occurring during the compilation. Section \ref{sec:Testing Errors} shows problems and solutions for errors, which may occur in testing.
\subsection{Errors while compiling}
This sections explains how build script errors can be resolved, which may appear while compiling projects and their plug-ins.

	\item[Cause] $ $\\
	The plug-in defining the missing classes and packages is not added correctly to the \texttt{includes} path element at the beginning of the file (c.f. Figure \vref{lst:Build script of the IVML Editor}). This can have multiple reasons:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item The related plug-in is not added to the \texttt{includes} path element.
		\item Some of the properties used inside the path element are pointing to the wrong location.
	\end{enumerate}
	\item[Solution] $ $
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Add the necessary plug-ins to the \texttt{includes} path element as described in Section \ref{sec:Managing Plug-in Dependencies}.
		\item Check whether the properties are pointing to the correct locations, i.e. where the plug-in jars are created. You can add the following code at the beginning of the \texttt{compile} target to see the current content of the \texttt{includes} path element\footnote{cf. comment by Alfonso Phocco at \url{http://www.jguru.com/faq/view.jsp?EID=471917}}:\\
		  \verb|echo message="${toString:includes}"|\\
		The printed result must not contain any ant variables in the form of\\
		\color{red}\verb|${|\color{black}\verb|<a property name>|\color{red}\verb|}|\color{black}.\\
		You should also verify whether the properties of the \texttt{global-build.properties} are pointing to the correct location. The \texttt{libs} properties should point to the created jar file inside the corresponding project, i.e. \texttt{home} property. For instance:\\
		\color{red}\verb|libs.model|\color{black}\verb|=${home.|\color{red}\verb|model.dir|\color{black}\verb|}/${build.jar.dir}/...varModel.jar|

\subsection{Errors while testing}
\label{sec:Testing Errors}
\subsubsection{Could not find plug-in}
\label{sec:Could not find plug-in}
\begin{description}
	\item[Description] $ $\\
		The automated test of the plug-in crashes with an error message as shown below:
		\footnotesize
			\verb|org.eclipse.test.EclipseTestRunner$TestFailedException:|\\
			\color{red}\verb|java.lang.Exception: Could not find plugin "de.uni-hildesheim.sse.<test plug-in name>"|\\

			\verb|    at ...|
		\normalsize
	\item[Cause] $ $\\
	The test plug-in could not be loaded by Eclipse. This means that either the test plug-in itself or one of the used plug-ins was not copied into the Eclipse test environment.
	\item[Solution] $ $\\
	Find the missing plug-ins and add them to the \texttt{copy.to.eclipse} target (see Figure \vref{lst:Adaption of build part 2}, lines 32 - 35). The easiest way of doing so, is to run the build script for the complete project on a local machine, start the OSGi console of the Eclipse instance for testing, and try to load the test plug-in. This can be done as follows:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Open a console for the \textit{plug-in}'s folder of the Eclipse instance for testing. After running the build script, the Eclipse instance is located at the \texttt{testEclipse} folder inside the \textit{project}'s folder.
		\item Open the OSGi console by running the command:\\
			\texttt{java -jar org.eclipse.equinox.launcher\_<version> -console}\\
			An example is given in Figure \vref{fig:Opening the OSGi console}.

			%\pic{0.75}{faq/OSGiConsole}{Opening the OSGi console}{Command for opening the OSGi console. This must be done inside the \textit{plug-in}'s folder of the Eclipse instance for testing after running the build script.}{Opening the OSGi console}
		\item Eclipse will ask for the workspace location. Ignore this window or accept it, but do not close the window as it will also stop the OSGi console.
		\item Run the command \texttt{ss} to list all installed OSGi bundles and search the test plug-in.
		\item If the plug-in is not listed, then install it with the command:\\
			\texttt{install file://<location>}\\
			Please note that you have to add a \texttt{\textbackslash} in front of the drive letter in Windows. An example is given in Figure \vref{fig:Installation of a Plug-in}.

				\label{fig:Installation of a Plug-in}
			\end{nofloat}
		\item Try to load the bundle with running the command:\\
			\texttt{start <plug-in number>}\\
			This should fail, but the displayed error message will give you a hint, which plug-in is missing. Figure \vref{fig:Start Plug-in} shows the useful error message.

			\end{nofloat}
		\item Check whether the crashing plug-in is located inside the \textit{plug-in}'s folder of the Eclipse instance for testing. Repeat the steps above, if the plug-in is located inside the \textit{plug-in}'s folder. Add the missing plug-in to the \texttt{copy.to.eclipse} target (see Figure \vref{lst:Adaption of build part 2}, lines 32 - 35).

			\verb|    at ...|
		\normalsize
	\item[Cause] $ $\\
	The specified class was not instrumented correctly. This can have multiple reasons:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item The Java file contains longer \texttt{static final String[]} definitions, which are not supported by Emma (cf. \url{http://sourceforge.net/p/emma/bugs/96/}).
	\end{enumerate}
	\item[Solution] $ $\\
	Depending on the cause, different solutions exist:	
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item In case a Java file contains longer \texttt{static final String[]} definitions, exclude this file from instrumentation. For this purpose, you have to add an exclusion filter to the \texttt{instrument} target (cf. Figure \vref{lst:Added exclusion filter}).

	This problem has several possible causes:	
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item This problem is related with the problem described in Section \vref{sec:Emma Method Error}.
		\item This problem also appears if referenced libraries are not packed into the plug-in's jar file. In this case, \color{red}\texttt{<class name>}\color{black}\ should be the name of a third party class, e.g. \texttt{org/apache/commons/io/FilenameUtils}.
	\end{enumerate}
	\item[Solution] $ $
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Solve the problem as described in Section \ref{sec:Emma Method Error}.
		\item Edit the \texttt{build-jk} file of the plug-in and add the \texttt{copy} task of Figure \vref{lst:Added necessary libraries} to the \texttt{jar} target.

\subsection{Errors after Updating Eclipse}
Several types of build and test execution errors may occur after updating an Eclipse on Jenkins. Many of them require individual resolution and also the symptoms may change, so we do not discuss them by their description/cause/solution rather by a brief summary. 
\begin{itemize}
    \item After updating the compile Eclipse, in particular various compile errors may occor. 
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Too long classpaths on the (Ant) console may occur due to our manual creation of the build path, which often just includes all available plugin Eclipse jars. Therefore, it is required that the compile Eclipse does not contain any source jars.
      \item Class version number is not correct. Sometimes, individual bundles in Eclipse switch the used compiler/JDK. So far, this did fortunately not occur for the dependencies of all \textbf{lower-level} EASy-Producer bundles that shall still be compiled with JDK 8, i.e., those including the EASy-Eclipse-core below the EASy-Producer UI. However, it occured for the Eclipse UI bundles and required utilizing JDK 11 also for the EASy-UI components. Due to a source code structure that assumed using the same JDK version for all code parts, lower-level builds with older JDK settings and UI parts with newer JDK settings may occur. This usually implies using a JDK 11 for builds, while setting the compiler compliance in the respective ANT build files (and accordingly in the \texttt{MANIFEST.MF} to the required JDK. However, this also implies that newer Java API functions may be utilized in lower-level EASy-Producer code without being reported as errors.
      \item The Eclipse p2 and director apps used for headless installation of (nightly) Eclipse apps may fail. Add to those failing build steps the command line option \texttt{-consoleLog} and analyze the OSGi errors. In particular, resolve erroneous JDK settings (e.g., Eclipse OSGi now also requires JDK 11). Typically, no critical bundles are missing except for UI bundles. When the app just complains about missing UI bundles, it typically works quite well although errors are reported (and the log files in the Eclipse \texttt{configuration} folder grow). However, it works, so remove \texttt{-consoleLog} from the ANT call.
      \item As soon as Eclipse p2 and director apps, the IU (installable unit) installation in the nightly builds may fail. Although it might look like missing bundles, due to our experience all required bundles are there. However, typically the utilized Eclipse product files are outdated and need revision. In these files, Eclipse just lists all required bundles for an IU installation. Due to the update of Eclipse, some of the bundles may just not be there anymore or may have been renamed. Fix these problems (leave the missing operating-system specific bundles in the product file as you have installed them with the new Eclipse) before thinking about missing (usually incompatible) Eclipse bundles.
    \end{itemize}
  \item The standalone tests may not work anymore. This may be due to the fact that we bundle Eclipse plugins into FAT jars. Then this process needs to be reviewed (but furtunately it typically works as it just relies on rather basic aspects of the OSGi dependency system). Similarly, also the (faked) bundle loading process of the EASyLoader may fail if there are signficant updates to OSGi (in particular after the Maven versions have been updated). Then it might be required to modify the code so that the fake OSGi version that we use complies with the changed interfaces.
  \item The installed IUs for the nightly bundles may not work. This may be due to the fact that the Eclipse director does not properly install the native executables. There are also mechanisms to adjust a build to the running JDK (as needed for JDK 9 with the advent of the module system). This part of the build process may require manual review and adjustment until the created installations work again.
\end{itemize}
