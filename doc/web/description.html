<h2>Recommendation</h2>
<p>EASy Producer requires Xtext at least in version 2.9.2 which will typically be installed with the tool automatically. However, if you encounter any errors regarding a missing Xtext installation, please install Xtext 2.9.2 via the <a href="http://download.eclipse.org/modeling/tmf/xtext/updates/composite/releases/">Xtext Update Site</a>. As we experienced some installation problems with 
Eclipse Indigo (required package validation), we currently recommend Eclipse Mars or Eclipse Neon.</p>
<h2>Nightly builds</h2>
<p>Instead of the released version, you may also try out the most recent nightly build. Below is a recommended installation procedure (which can also help in case of installation problems with the released version):
<ol>
 <li>Install JDK 1.8</li>
 <li>Install the latest version of Eclipse, e.g., for <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-ide-eclipse-committers/neon3">Eclipse Neon for committers</a> (please select according to your OS)</li>
 <li>Restart Eclipse</li>
 <li>Install EASy Nightly Core Bundles from http://projects.sse.uni-hildesheim.de/eclipse/update-sites/easy_nightly/</li>
 <li>Restart Eclipse</li>
</ol>
We tested EASy-Producer also with Eclipse 4.19.0, where -Dosgi.dataAreaRequiresExplicitInit=true must be commented out in eclipse.ini. Due to dependencies to older Eclipse bundles, EASy-Producer may not run with newer versions of Eclipse.
