This is the EASy-Producer documentation folder.

In particular, it contains the IVML/VIL language specifications, the user documentation and the developer guides (as well as the release documentation). 

Since 2018, this folder also contains parts of the EASy update website, in particular the PDFs and the changelog. The files in web will be considered by the continuous build process for automated publication to the EASy update sites upon change/after building the nightly update site. During a release, please update the PDFs in web/docRelease. If documentations are significantly updated so that they shall become preview documentations, please create respective PDFs and copy them to web/docPreview. Moreover, please update the web/changelog.html to reflect your changes, including HTML references to closed github tasks.
